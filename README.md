# Morse Typing Trainer for Gboard
This is a fork of the original [Google/Tania Finlayson Morse code trainer](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/morse-learn). Adapted to help people with a visual impairment - but also because many people prefer Auditory Mnemoics better than visual ones for learning morse code.

Main differences:

- Uses auditory cues - for correct/wrong and auditory mnemoic hints
- Fixes a lot of problems with the original about not running in different browsers. The demo didn't reliably detect browsers/platforms.

*Use with a dot and dash keyboard keys - or map switches to these keys*
